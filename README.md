# Tetris-in-C++
Tetris made in C++ using raylib.

This project is a Tetris clone built using C++ and the Raylib game development library. The game implements the classic Tetris gameplay where players must arrange falling blocks, called Tetrominoes, to complete and clear full rows. As the game progresses, the speed of the falling blocks increases, making it more challenging to keep the screen clear.

This project demonstrates core concepts of game development, including collision detection, real-time user input, and rendering with a game library, as well as offering an engaging experience with smooth controls.
